# ERON + PermaShield

This repository contains the **official public technical dossier** for the  
**ERON (Energy-Resilient Oasis Node)** and **PermaShield (HTM-FRP Arctic Stabilization Platform)** project.

## Purpose
ERON + PermaShield is a decentralized, AI-assisted climate resilience system designed to:
- Stabilize permafrost and critical infrastructure
- Detect and repair structural degradation autonomously
- Permanently remove biogenic carbon with verified MRV
- Operate as a population-scale infrastructure network

What this is

ERON + PermaShield is a research-stage, open technical system for autonomous infrastructure resilience in extreme environments (permafrost regions, Arctic infrastructure, remote sites).

It combines:

AI-based structural health monitoring (CLSEREP)

Autonomous repair decision logic

Carbon removal & MRV accounting

Federated learning across distributed nodes

Fail-safe, offline-first system design

The goal is not climate reversal, but buying time by preventing catastrophic infrastructure failure while reducing emissions and methane release.

What this is NOT

❌ Not a promise of climate reversal

❌ Not a finished commercial product

❌ Not a speculative sci-fi concept

❌ Not a crypto / NFT / hype project

This is an engineering system under active prototyping, designed to be tested, criticised, and improved.

Core Subsystems

CLSEREP — CNN-based crack detection (FNR ≈ 0.15%, ROC-AUC ≈ 0.9998)

ERON Node — energy, waste-to-resource, carbon handling

PermaShield — thermal + structural ground stabilisation

MRV Ledger — carbon removal tracking (conceptual blockchain integration)

Federated Learning — shared model improvement without raw data transfer

Failsafe & Security Layer — anomaly detection, air-gapped safe mode

Current Status

✅ Real CNN trained on Kaggle + SDNET datasets

✅ Measured inference speed (~17 inferences/sec on edge-class hardware)

✅ False Negative Rate quantified

✅ Federated learning simulated across nodes

✅ UI dashboard prototype (Streamlit)

⚠️ Hardware fabrication not yet deployed

⚠️ Carbon removal figures are scenario-based, not claims

Why this matters

Permafrost thaw is a climate tipping point causing:

Infrastructure collapse (roads, pipelines, buildings)

Methane release

Flooding and erosion

Loss of community viability

This project addresses prevention, not reaction.
